Child safety wearable comes from the increasing need for safety for children in current times
as there could be scenarios of the child getting lost in the major crowded areas and child
getting into harmful environment . This paper focuses on the key aspect that lost child can be
helped by the people around the child and can play a significant role in the child's safety until
reunited with the parents. Most of the wearable available today are focused on providing the
location, activity, etc. of the child to the parents via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth[18]which seems to be
unreliable source of communication. Therefore it is intended to use SMS as the mode of
communication between the parent and child's wearable device, as this has fewer chances of
failing compared to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This project will be running on Arduino Uno
microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, and the functions of sending and receiving
SMS,calls and connecting to the internet which is provided by the Arduino GSM shield using
the GSM network. Also, additional modules employed which will provide the current location
of the child to the parents via SMS and warns the parent through SMS if any fire accident
occurs or any combustible gas is around the child . The second measure added is SOS Light
indicator that will be programmed with Arduino UNO board to display the SOS signal using
Morse code. The different modules stay enclosed in a custom designed 3D printed case.
Therefore alerting the people around the child that the child is in some distress and needs
assistance as the SOS signal is universally known as the signal for help needed. Additionally,
the wearable comes equipped with a distress alarm buzzer which sets to active by sending the
SMS keyword "BUZZ" to the wearable. Hence the buzzer is loud and can be heard by the
parent from very considerable distance. Also the parents via SMS can receive accurate
coordinates of the child, which can help them locate the child with pinpoint accuracy.

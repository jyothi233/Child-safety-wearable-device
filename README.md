# Child-safety-wearable-device

Child safety wearable comes from the increasing need for safety for children .The major advantage
of this wearable over other wearable is that it can be used in any cell phone and doesn't necessarily
require a savvy individual to operate. Most of the wearable available today are focused on providing
the location , activity, etc. of the child to the parents providing via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth which
seems to be an unreliable source of communication. This device is to help parents locate their child
with ease and also alerts the parent quickly when the child is in unfavorable conditions like fire,
harmful gases. Therefore, this paper is to have an SMS text enabled communication medium
between the child's wearable and the parent using GSM mobile communication. The parent can
send a text with specific keywords such as "LOCATION" "TEMPERATURE" "UV" "SOS"
"BUZZ", etc., the wearable device will reply back with a text containing the real time accurate
location of the child which upon tapping will provide directions to the child's location on Google
maps app and will also provide the surrounding temperature, UV radiation index so that the parents
can keep track .It also alerts with SMS text to the parent when the child is in an environment where
harmful gases like H2,CH4,CO,ALCOHOL,SMOKE. For the secondary safety measure the device
alerts the people present in the surrounding of the child who could instantly react for the child's
safety till the parents arrive or they could contact the parents and help locate them. In this scenario,
a lost child can be located by the parent could send an SMS to the wearable device which would
activate the SOS light feature on the wearable. Therefore alerting the people around the child that
the child is in some distress and needs assistance as the SOS signal is universally known as the
signal for help needed
